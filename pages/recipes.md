This cookbook, a collection of 10 handpicked recipes, introduces the reader to the often overlooked and relatively unknown wonders of Korean cooking. Everyone knows what Japanese sushi is and there's probably a Chinese restaurant within a mile of where you're sitting now, but what is Korean food? Healthy, addictive, and growing in popularity, Korean cuisine is famous for its balancing and use of the five main tastes: sweet, sour, spicy, salty, and bitter. The rising tide of Korean culture brings with it these ten recipes, chosen for their relative fame, ease of assembly, and – of course – amazing taste. Korean food can be hard to approach, at first. What are these ingredients I’ve never heard of? How do I even pronounce the name of this recipe? This cookbook exists to guide you into the world of East Asian Korean cuisine, breaking everything down, simplifying each step, and enabling you to taste the food everyone’s going crazy about from the comfort of your own home.
