In my last post I wrote about the types of jobs present in the publishing industry and the importance of each to the whole. In this, my final blog post in this series about publishing related topics, I will talk about _actually working_ in the publishing industry, explaining how to go about it and clearing up some misconceptions along the way.

Do you need an English literature degree to get a job in publishing? No, not at all. Sure, it might be helpful in showing that you are indeed interested in books, but publishing is a business and to succeed it needs to attract various minds and new ideas. In a lot of cases, people working in publishing industry studied seemingly totally unrelated subjects (such as STEM subjects) and either attain master’s degrees in publishing or seek out publishing related work experience. The paths to publishing are various and there’s no right way to enter, but passion and dedication are half the journey.

But how do you even get your foot in the door? Whilst it’s true the are a lot of roles available in publishing, it is also true that there are many more applicants for these positions then there are available jobs. So, what are you going to do? One idea might be to **ignore companies** altogether – plenty of copywriters, proof-readers, and designers work **freelance** and build up a reputation that way. If you’re so inclined, you could set-up a portfolio online today and start networking. If that’s not for you? There’s still good news. As with any kind of interview or job application, the key to getting your foot in the door in publishing is to **stand out**. Read books, of course, but is your reading books really the only thing that makes you qualified for a publishing career? Be **passionate** and don’t be narrowminded. Apply **everywhere**. Apply for everything. It’s easier to move laterally into another job once you’re in the publishing industry, but if you’re only applying for editorial positions at the two companies you like, chances are you’re not going to get anywhere anytime soon.

If you want to work in publishing, you can. There’s a role for everyone from every background and, if you have the desire, there will always be somewhere that needs what you have to offer. Don’t be naïve: publishing isn’t about sitting in an armchair reading books all day; there’s much more to this wonderful industry than that. You just need to find your place, and everything will be okay.

Finally, here are some websites that offer professional advice and, if you're serious about applying for a publishing job, I'd recommend taking at least a quick look at some:
