Forbes reported that “U.S. Audiobook Sales Neared $1 Billion In 2018, Growing 25% Year-Over-Year”  in an article which detailed the rise of audiobooks. This format, the descendant of the audio CD, has seen an impressive rise in popularity in recent years, dominating in many of the ways eBooks were expected to do so. But there is an interesting caveat to this success: “the percentage of Americans who have ever listened to an audiobook stands at 44%, just one point up from 2015's 43%”  which suggests that the consumer base for audiobooks hasn’t expanded. So why are sales increasing?

The most likely and simplest explanation for this rise is that it’s simply easier to listen to audiobooks than ever before. Centralized platforms such as Amazon’s Audible and improvements in technology (wireless headphones and more functional apps) have in no small way bolstered audiobooks viability as a means of consuming media.

It’s also important to acknowledge the general benefits of audiobooks. Those people who want to read but don’t feel as though they have the time have no doubt been drawn in by this audiobook surge. Whether they’re on the way to work, cooking a meal, or doing the laundry, this demographic of reader’s can now multitask. Why waste time reading a paperback when you can work and play? Audiobooks are a format which fit perfect into the scenery of a modern lifestyle in which time is precious but those who love to read still need a way to make time for their hobby.

One must note too, the rise of the podcast. In fact, most audio-based forms of media have seen a rise whilst the paperback saw a 5% decline in 2018 . Recorded music grew by 12% and vinyl record sales by 8%. The way in which we consume media appears to be changing. You can’t watch a TV program whilst driving. It’s hard to read a book while you hoover the carpet. Audio formats mitigate these problems.

Another way to gauge the success of these formats is to notice the kinds of attention the now receive. Celebrities now read for audiobooks (such as Elisabeth Moss for ‘The Handmaiden’s Tale’ and Michelle Obama reading her own novel ) and famous authors are now creating ‘straight-to-audio’ works (such as Phillip Pullman’s ‘The Collectors’). Audiobooks have begun to garner a lot of attention and with a projected market increase of up to 25% by 2020 , the rise doesn’t seem to be slowing down.

But, as anyone familiar with the publishing industry knows, it’s best not to get carried away. Where once everyone thought the eBook would kill print, there is now stagnation. Will the audiobook format revolutionize publishing? It’s unlikely. But it’s popularity as a format should be closely monitored and it’ll no doubt remain popular with those who enjoy them going forward, even if the market growth begins to flatline because audiobooks are convenient, fun, and perfect for the modern age.
