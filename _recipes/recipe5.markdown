# Tteokbokki

Tteok-bokki or stir-fried rice cakes is a popular Korean food made from small-sized garae-tteok called tteokmyeon or commonly tteok-bokki-tteok. Eomuk, boiled eggs, and scallions are some of the most commonly added ingredients.

## Ingredients

- 1 pound tteokbokki tteok
- 1 sheet eomuk (fish cake)
- 4 ounces green cabbage (yangbaechu)
- 1 - 2 scallions
- 3 cups anchovy broth or water
- 3 tablespoons Korean red chili pepper paste gochujang
- 1 - 3 teaspoons Korean red chili pepper flakes gochugaru
- 1 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon corn syrup or 1 more tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic

## Method

1. Make anchovy broth (see note). Soak the rice cakes for about 20 minutes if hardened or refrigerated. Cut the fish cake, cabbage, and scallions into about 2-inch long pieces.
2. Add the anchovy broth (or water) to a large pan. Stir in the sauce ingredients. Bring it to a boil over medium high heat, stirring to dissolve the red chili pepper paste (gochujang).
3. Add the rice cakes. Boil until the rice cakes become very soft and the sauce is thickened, about 8 - 10 minutes. Stir frequently so the rice cakes don't stick to the bottom of the pan.
4. Add the vegetables and fish cakes. Continue to boil, stirring constantly, for an additional 4 - 6 minutes. Depending on rice cakes, you may need more time to reach a desired level of softness. Add more broth or water as necessary. Taste the sauce, and adjust the seasoning if needed. Serve immediately.
