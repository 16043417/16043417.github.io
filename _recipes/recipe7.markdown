# Bibimbap

Bibimbap, sometimes romanized as bi bim bap or bi bim bop, is a Korean rice dish. The term "bibim" means mixing various ingredients, while the "bap" noun refers to rice. Bibimbap is served as a bowl of warm white rice topped with namul or kimchi and gochujang, soy sauce, or doenjang.

## Ingredients

### Meat and meat sauce

- 100g / 3.5 ounces beef mince (or other cuts)
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp sugar – I used brown sugar
- ¼ tsp minced garlic

### Vegetables and other

- 250g (0.6 pounds) mildly seasoned spinach
- 350g (0.8 pounds) mildly seasoned bean sprouts – (You don’t have to use them up if you think it’s too much but I love having lots of vegetables on my Bibimbap!)
- 100g (3.5 ounces) shiitake mushroom
- 120g (4.2 ounces) carrots (1 small)
- ½ tsp fine sea salt (¼ tsp each will be used when cooking shiitake mushroom and carrots)
- 3 to 4 serving portions of steamed rice
- 3 or 4 eggs (depending on the serving portion)
- Some cooking oil to cook the meat, mushroom, carrots and eggs – I used rice bran oil.
- Korean seasoned seaweed, shredded (long thin cut)

### Bibimbap sauce

- 2 Tbsp gochujang
- 1 Tbsp sesame oil
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 1 Tbsp water
- 1 Tbsp roasted sesame seeds
- 1 tsp vinegar
- 1 tsp minced garlic

## Method

1. For meat, mix the beef mince with the meat sauce listed above. Marinate the meat for about 30 mins while you are working on other ingredients to enhance the flavour. Add some cooking oil into a wok and cook the meat on medium high to high heat. It takes about 3 to 5 mins to thoroughly cook it.
2. Mix the Bibimbap sauce ingredients in a bowl.
3. Spinach and bean sprouts per linked recipe.
4. Rinse, peel and julienne the carrots. Add some cooking oil and 1/4 tsp of fine sea salt in a wok and cook the carrots on medium high to high heat for 2 to 3 mins.
5. Clean/rinse the shiitake mushrooms and thinly slice them. Add some cooking oil and ¼ tsp of fine sea salt in a wok and cook the mushrooms on medium high to high heat until they are all cooked.
6. Fry eggs
7. Put the rice into a bowl and add the meat, assorted vegetables, seasoned seaweed, Bibimbap sauce and the egg on top of the rice.
8. Serve it.
9. Mix the ingredients well in the bowl and enjoy!
