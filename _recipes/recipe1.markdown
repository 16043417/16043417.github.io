# Bulgogi

Bulgogi, literally "fire meat", is a _gui_ made of thin, marinated slices of beef or pork grilled on a barbecue or on a stove-top griddle. It is also often stir-fried in a pan in home cooking. Sirloin, rib eye or brisket are frequently used cuts of beef for the dish. The dish originated from northern areas of the Korean Peninsula, but is a very popular dish in South Korea where it can be found anywhere from upscale restaurants to local supermarkets as pan-ready kits.

## Ingredients

- 1 ½ lb ribeye steak (700 g), or any other well-marbled, tender cut
- 1 onion, 1/2 roughly chopped and 1/2 thinly sliced
- 3 cloves garlic cloves
- ½ pear, peeled and roughly chopped
- 3 spring onions, 1 cut into pieces and 2 sliced into 1/4-inch rounds
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- ⅓ cup soy sauce (80 g)
- 3 tablespoons sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 1 teaspoon sesame seed, for serving
- 2 cups cooked rice (400 g), for serving

## Method

1. Slice the beef as thinly as you can, then set aside in a large bowl. Using frozen or cold beef will make the slicing easier.
2. In a blender or food processor, blend the onion chunks, garlic, pear, green onion pieces, brown sugar, pepper, soy sauce, and sesame oil until smooth.
3. Pour the marinade over the beef, add the thinly sliced onion, then mix to coat evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, or overnight.
4. Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over high heat. Pat the meat dry.
5. Being careful not to crowd the pan, sear the marinated beef and onions until browned. Sprinkle with the sliced green onions and sesame seeds.
6. Serve with rice and side dishes.
